# While the alignment is this fresh we believe it outright, which keeps the

# it is right - it may be a stale value reloaded from storage - so the ceiling
# also takes the pairing-derived bound, which is independent of runtime state.
# Widening only applies to accessories we cannot currently see, which is exactly
# when a wider net is worth paying for.

# The floor was pinned at exactly the aligned index, which assumes an accessory
# never appears below where we last saw it. Observed otherwise on real hardware:
# a tag aligned at 315 was found advertising 314, one index under the floor, and
# was therefore invisible - the same lockout as a too-low ceiling, from the other
# end. Key indices are monotonic in theory, but our record of them comes from
# estimates and storage that can be wrong, so the floor needs slack. A few
# indices cost a handful of curve operations.
FINDMY_LOOKBEHIND_INDICES: Final[int] = 8
# An accessory we've never confirmed a sighting for has an unbounded search window
# (it may have been paired years ago). Cap it - a tag that is present and

# window via alignment. 2880 indices is 30 days.
